Landing page for the Quickstart VM

# How to use / improve

Clone this repository and make edits to the `.Rmd` files and assets located in
the root directory. When completed, render the R Markdown website by rendering the `index.Rmd`(?) (or each item individually?).

Once rendered, the assets in `_site` should be updated. Commit these changes, as
the `_site` directory is used verbatim in the Quickstart VM.
