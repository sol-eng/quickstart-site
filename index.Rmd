Welcome to the RStudio Professional Quickstart

The RStudio Professional Quickstart is a Virtual Machine with RStudio Professional products installed and configured to simplify the illustration of business value. It is primarily intended as a conversation starter. It is _not_ supported for use in any production capacity. If business value is determined, then the Quickstart should be followed by a proof of concept or other more formal integration into enterprise infrastructure.
