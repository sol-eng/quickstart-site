5) Once the new report is generated, you can press the `Save As` button to save the newly generated report.

### Plumber API

RStudio Connect can host APIs that wrap functions in your existing models and code. The APIs can then be called from other projects published to RStudio Connect or queried from external systems or languages.

Let's view and query a published API to obtain historical prices for a given stock ticker symbol.

![](images/rstudio-connect-published-api.png)

1) From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published API called `Stock Information Plumber API`.
1) Click the `/price` bar near the bottom of the screen to expand the details of the endpoint.
2) Click the `Try it Out` button to show the fields for the inputs to the API endpoint.
3) Enter `AAPL` in the `ticker` field.
4) Click the execute button to submit a request to the API endpoint.

The results of the query appear in the response body field, which shows the historical returned as a JSON object. This API could be queried by other published assets or consumed by systems external to RStudio Connect using API tokens.

## User Exercises

RStudio Connect is powered by R and has the ability to run all of your data products in production and allow them to be used by other people within your organization.

The tasks in this section would be performed by a user in RStudio Connect.

### Adding collaborators

For each deployed project, you can define users that can view the published version of content and users that can make changes to the content.

Let's add a collaborator to a Shiny application and give them the ability to view and make changes to the application.

![](images/rstudio-connect-collaborator.png)

1) From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published document called `Stock Portfolio Shiny Application`.
2) Click the `Access` tab in the project settings on the right side of the screen.
3) Add the user `publisher` as a collaborator by typing their username in the field under `Who can change this document`.
4) Click the `publisher` user to add them as a collaborator to this project.

Now, the `publisher` user has the ability to view, manage, and update this application.

### Scaling Shiny apps

RStudio Connect allows you to manage the runtime and performance settings of published Shiny applications.

## Publishing Content

Users can configure their RStudio Desktop IDE or RStudio Server Pro to easily publish content to RStudio Connect with the click of a button.

![](images/rstudio-connect-publish-from-ide.png)

You can configure the RStudio Desktop IDE on your local machine to publish to RStudio Connect in the QuickStart. This allows you to try push-button publishing for your own content. Refer to the documentation to connect your [RStudio IDE to RStudio Connect](http://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting.html).

The URL of the RStudio Connect server in the QuickStart that you should configure is:

```
http://localhost:5000/rsconnect
```

Once you've connected the account to your RStudio IDE, you can publish content to RStudio Connect.

Note that this functionality will only work from an RStudio Desktop IDE that is running on the same machine as the RStudio QuickStart virtual machine.
