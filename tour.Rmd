In the following sections, we'll explore the full functionality of RStudio Connect.

You can follow through the tasks in sequential order, starting with user tasks and continuing to administrator tasks. Or, you can jump directly to a task and perform the steps described in that section.

## Getting Started

The RStudio QuickStart is pre-populated with apps, reports, and APIs that have been published.

* **Shiny Apps**. Host, manage, and scale your Shiny applications.
* **R Markdown Documents**. Schedule and distribute your R Markdown documents and reports.
* **Plumber APIs**. Expose any R function as an API.

### Logging in

First, we'll log in and view the data products that have been published to RStudio Connect.

Navigate to the <a href="rsconnect/" target="_blank">RStudio Connect interface</a>.

Explore the published Shiny application by:

1) Hovering over different dates in the time series to view the Sortino Ratio for a given date.
2) Changing the zoom level of the data for different ranges.
3) Switching to different tabs along the bottom to view the data as a scatterplot, histogram, or density plot.
4) Changing the parameters on the left in terms of portfolio risk level, starting date, MAR, and window.

### R Markdown Report

From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published document called `Stock Portfolio Report`, which will open the published report in the content portion of the screen along with controls for the application on the right side of the screen.

This R Markdown report is parameterized and can be re-run with different settings and saved, emailed to other collaborators and viewers, or scheduled to be run on a recurring basis.

4) Once the new report is generated, you can press the `Save As` button to save the newly generated report.

### Plumber API

From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published API called `Stock Information Plumber API`, which will open the published API and show the endpoints that are available. In this published API, there are two endpoints that can be queried.

Let's query the `/price` endpoint to get historical prices for a given ticker symbol.

1) Click the `/price` bar near the bottom of the screen to expand the details of the endpoint.
2) Click the `Try it Out` button to show the fields for the inputs to the API endpoint.
3) Enter `AAPL` in the `ticker` field.
4) Click the execute button to submit a request to the API endpoint.

The results of the query appear in the response body field, which shows the historical returned as a JSON object. This API could be queried by other published assets or consumed by systems external to RStudio Connect using API tokens.

## User Exercises

RStudio Connect is powered by R, so it knows how to run all of your data products. Perform these tasks in RStudio Connect.

### Adding collaborators

For each deployed project, you can define which types of users can access the published version of content and who can make changes to the content.

Let's add a collaborator to a Shiny app.

1) From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published document called `Stock Portfolio Shiny Application`.
2) Click the `Access` tab in the project settings on the right side of the screen.
3) Add the user `publisher` as a collaborator by typing their username in the field under `Who can change this document`.
4) Click the `publisher` user to add them as a collaborator to this project.

After configuring these new runtime settings, your Shiny app will be able to scale up as needed to handle a higher number of concurrent users and connections.

### Sending reports by email

From the RStudio Connect landing page, click on the published document called `Stock Portfolio Report`, which will open the published report. This parameterized document contains multiple inputs that can be varied, then the report can be re-run and the output can be saved as new versions of the report.

Let's change some of the parameters and send a copy of the report via email.

1) Click the `Input` drawer on the left side of the report.
2) Change the `Start Date` to `2010-02-01`.
3) Change the `portfolio` field to `aggressive_portfolio_returns`.
4) Click the `Run Report` button.
5) After the new output is shown, click the `Save` button, enter a name for the new report, and click `OK`.
6) On the top right navigation bar, click the email icon.

## Publishing Content

Push-button publishing is an easy way to publish content from the RStudio IDE or Server Pro to RStudio Connect.

You can configure the RStudio IDE on your local machine to try out publishing of your own content to the instance of RStudio Connect in the QuickStart. Refer to the documentation to connect your [RStudio IDE to RStudio Connect](http://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/connecting.html).

The URL of your RStudio Connect server in the QuickStart is `http://localhost:5000/rsconnect`.

Once you've connected the account to your RStudio IDE, you can publish content to RStudio Connect.
